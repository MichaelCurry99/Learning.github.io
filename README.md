# What-I've-Learned-Using-Repos

I now know the basics of how to setup text styles in a different way, such as adding bold and italic fonts to experiment on how the repository works. I've had 
a small problem when it came to using some of the coding, since I usually use replit to add images and links. Although the coding works differently, I feel like I
have entered a different realm now. Using the basics of coding, I can see how the addition of images work, especially when it comes to making my own profile. Though it may not
be my best now, continuing to add more different features on GitHub will help me advance into coding. This is a new platform for me to help further my experience into the world
of coding.
    
The first time Markdown was mentioned, it had to have been a part of the repository that made certain codes to do certain things. When coding them, I can remember what is to insert an image, bold, link, paragraph, and much more. Now that I know some of the basics, it's time to learn more of how to code using GitHub. I feel like this is the best way to learn and that is by continually learning new ways to do things in your field. Hopefully, I can grasp as much as I can when it comes to coding!
