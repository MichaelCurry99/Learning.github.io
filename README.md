# What-I've-Learned-Using-Repos
         I now know the basics of how to setup text styles in a different way, such as adding bold and italic fonts to experiment on how the repository works. I've had 
    a small problem when it came to using some of the coding, since I usually use replit to add images and links. Although the coding works differently, I feel like I
    have entered a different realm now. Using the basics of coding, I can see how the addition of images work, especially when it comes to making my own profile. Though it may not
    be my best now, continuing to add more different features on GitHub will help me advance into coding. This is a new platform for me to help further my experience into the world
    of coding.
    
         The first time Markdown was mentioned, it had to have been a part of the repository that made certain codes do certain things.
